Vim-easy-align defines interactive `:EasyAlign` command in the visual mode.

For convenience, it is advised that you define a mapping for triggering it
in your `.vimrc`.

    vnoremap <silent> <Enter> :EasyAlign<cr>

With this mapping, you can align selected lines with a few keystrokes.

1. <Enter> key to start interactive EasyAlign command
2. Optional Enter keys to toggle right-justification mode
3. Optional field number (default: 1)
    1        Alignment around 1st delimiter
    2        Alignment around 2nd delimiter
    ...
    *        Alignment around all delimiters (recursive)
    -        Alignment around the last delimiters (-1)
    -2       Alignment around the one before the last delimiters
4. Delimiter
    <space>  General alignment around whitespaces
    =        Operators containing equals sign (=, ==, !=, +=, &&=, ...)
    :        Suitable for formatting JSON or YAML
    .        Multi-line method chaining
    ,        Multi-line method arguments. CSV.
    }        Closing braces (Try using it with a negative field number)
    |        Table markdown

During the key sequence, <Enter> key will toggle right-justification mode.


Examples:

  <Enter>=         Alignment around 1st equals sign (and the likes)
  <Enter>2=        Alignment around 2nd equals sign (and the likes)
  <Enter>3=        Alignment around 3rd equals sign (and the likes)
  <Enter>*=        Alignment around all equals signs (and the likes)
  <Enter><Enter>=  Right-justified alignment around 1st equals signs
  <Enter><space>   Alignment around 1st whitespace
  <Enter>2<space>  Alignment around 2nd whitespace
  <Enter>-<space>  Alignment around the last whitespaces
  <Enter>:         Alignment around 1st colon
  <Enter>-}        Alignment around the last closing braces


Partial alignment in blockwise-visual mode:

In blockwise-visual mode (`CTRL-V`), EasyAlign command aligns only
the selected parts, instead of the whole lines in the range.


Defining custom alignment rules:

let g:easy_align_delimiters = {
\ '>': { 'pattern': '>>\|=>\|>' },
\ '/': { 'pattern': '//*' },
\ ')': {
\     'pattern':       ')',
\     'margin_left':   '',
\     'margin_right':  '',
\     'stick_to_left': 0
\   }
\ }
